  <h1>Thanks for visiting</h1>
  <div class="highlight">
    <h2>We are permanently closed</h2>
    <p>As of 2021, we have decided to stop growing potatoes, and as such we have closed our farm shop and market stall.</p>
    <p>We would like to thank every one of our customers for your support over the many decades.</p>
  </div>

  <p>We're a family run farm, who specialized in growing the very best in Tipperary potatoes. We operated a farm shop,
    stocking the very best of local produce, located on the old Dublin Road (R639), between Cahir and New Inn. We
    are also a founding member of Cahir Farmer's Market and have held a stall there every Saturday, since 2003.</p>

  <p><a href="http://cahirfarmersmarket.ie/">Cahir Farmer's Market</a> is still operating every Saturday, and we recommend a visit to purchase the very best of local produce.</p>
